# Autoregressive Process of Order 2 and Yule-Walker Equation

This Python script demonstrates the autoregressive process of order 2 (AR(2)) and the Yule-Walker equations. It utilizes various libraries for numerical computations and visualization.

## Libraries Used:
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `cmath`: For complex math operations.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing.
- `spectrum`: For spectral analysis.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization.
- `statsmodels`: For time series analysis.

## Usage:
1. **Generating White Gaussian Noise:**
    - The script generates white Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

2. **Simulating AR(2) Processes:**
    - AR(2) coefficients are defined and used to generate simulated data.
    - Multiple examples of AR(2) processes are plotted for visualization.

3. **Yule-Walker Equations for AR Coefficients:**
    - Yule-Walker equations are applied to compute the roots (poles) of the AR(2) process.
    - Examples are provided along with the calculated roots.

4. **Estimating AR Coefficients Using Yule-Walker Method:**
    - AR coefficients are estimated using the Yule-Walker method.
    - The method is applied to examples with different AR coefficients, and the results are printed.

**Note:** Replace the AR coefficients and parameters as needed for your specific analysis.

## Running the Script:
- Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- Copy the script into your Python environment.
- Run the script to observe the generation of white noise, simulation of AR(2) processes, computation of AR coefficients using the Yule-Walker equations, and estimation of AR coefficients using the Yule-Walker method.
